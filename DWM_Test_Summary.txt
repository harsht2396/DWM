Steps : 

1) First of all I validated the data columns and values.
2) Validated the data types for respective columns and decided which data type would be best.
3) Observed, there are multiple values exceeding integer range(2,147,483,647) so I did chose BIGINT. 

4) For filling the blank columns I used the formulas in excel as below - 
	a. ROA (return on assets) : (Net Income/Total Assets)*100, but we want to calculate 
		ROA(YTD annualized) : (Net Income/Total Assets)*(12/11)*100
		- we have values as of Nov-24 so taking 11

	b.Average Loan Size - Gross Loan Portfolio (GLP)/ Number of Active Borrowers
	c.solvency -(company's ability to pay its long-term debts and stay solvent)
		total equity/total assets
	d.Operating Expense Ratio - the efficiency of an organization's operations by comparing operating expenses to its revenue or gross 
	OLER - For this Operating expense is required or any type of expense which is done on daily basis. which I couldn't find. So if there is any other column to be 	used/other formula please enlighten me. 
	 OLER is actually the Open Loan Exposure. (PARs – Reserves) / Equity.	

	PAR - Past Due Assets: These are loans or financial obligations where the borrower has failed to make timely payments. The "past due" classification often applies when the payment is overdue by a specific period, such as 30 days, 60 days, etc.

OLER (Operating Expense Ratio) = loan portfolio (GLP) (Operating Expenses + Loan Loss Reserves Gross Loan Portfolio (GLP))× 100
*****	Open Loan Exposure. (PARs – Reserves) / Equity.

5) Updated portfolio_DB as part of transformation. Made fund-1,2,3 as rows by doing pivot. so it can align with risk_db's fund column.
6) Stored both of them in different CSV. 
7) Created test DB and imported in SQL in two different tables.
8) Standardized the fields name like Borrower to MFI_Name , borrower country to country and Total_Amount to Total_Amount_Invested.
9) Implemented ETL logic for mapping MFI_Name to match in both tables by creating [vw_Portfolio_DB].
10)Implemented ETL logic for mapping REGION name to match in both tables by creating [vw_risk_DB].
11)Selected total amount invested from both the views joining region,country,borrower and fund to find difference.
